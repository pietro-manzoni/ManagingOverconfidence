In this folder, you find the code and the results for the paper 
"Managing Overconfidence in Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting with an Application to Electricity Consumption", R.Baviera & P.Manzoni (2024)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The empirical analyses were conducted using our library for RNN models, available at:
https://github.com/pietro-manzoni/RNNP


We provide in this folder the scripts and the files for the results of present study, divided as follows: 

> final_dataset:			GEFCom2017 dataset;

> main_model_training.cpp	:	main file used for generating the forecasts with Neural Networks using our library;

> mainBenchmarks.py:		main file used to generate forecasts with the benchmark models;
> mainAnalysisAndPlots.py:	main file used to process results and compute accuracy tables and plots;
> utilities.py:		   	additional functions used in the Python code.
